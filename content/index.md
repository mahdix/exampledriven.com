This website is dedicated to examples of different programming languages which are trying to help coders get started in learning a new language.

The main focus of this website is simplicity and being straight forward. We try to provide minimal, complete and verifiable code examples <https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve> 
to teach a specific point about a programming language.

This is a public website, anyone can contribute! If you want to help, simply go to <https://github.com/mahdix/exampledriven.com/> and create your PR to add or edit a content.
