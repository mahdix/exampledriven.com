**Welcome to ExampleDriven!**

This website is to help coders get started with learning a new language or busy developer who do not have time to read tons of cryptic manuals.

# Objective

The primary focus of this website is simplicity and being straight forward. We try to provide minimal, complete and verifiable code examples ([MCVE](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve))
to teach a specific point about a programming language. This means that content must be:

1. **Minimal**: Should be minimal without anything additional which is not directly used to convey the point.
2. **Readable**: Avoid using meaningless names and notations.
3. **Complete**: Should include all relevant parts and be testable in a development environment.
4. **Verifiable**: There should be a clear and minimal explanation of the point/problem that content is trying to solve or answer.

# Structure

Each content is categorized under a programming languages and a  specific group (e.g. Java programming language and OOP).
It includes these parts:

 1. **Question**: A complete, clear and well-written question that the content is trying to answer (e.g. What does `finally` do?)
 2. **Answer**: A short code example which demonstrates the solution to the question and also explans _Why_'s. Although any exaplanation is better be in the form of comments inside the code, in rare cases the answer section can start with a short non-code explanation.
 3. **Reference**: In case there are other resources (documentation, forum, source code, ...) that can be useful for the reader, they will be listed in this part.
 4. **Author**: Name and link to profile of the author.
